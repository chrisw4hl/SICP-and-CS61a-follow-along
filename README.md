# SICP-and-CS61a-follow-along

This is my collection of code generated and resourses used to follow along with UCB CS61A SP2011.

The course lectures are hosted at https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter

I have also uploaded the deb file for the STK evaluator, which I found by searching through the UCB website.
I was not able to get the stk interpreter working on a 64 bit arch system, as I believe the deb is only usable on a 32 bit system.

The course reader website I found with the resourses for this course is here: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol1.html

Not all of my code is working or correct, especially the deque implementation and an exercise with search and the AMB evaluator.

I do not intend to overstep any copywrite protections by preserving reference information.
My only intentions are to preserve this information in case it is lost from the UCB website in the future.
I enjoyed following along with this course focues on SICP, thanks to the suggestion of teachyourselfcs.com.
